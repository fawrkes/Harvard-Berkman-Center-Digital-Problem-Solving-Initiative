Harvard-Berkman-Center-Digital-Problem-Solving-Initiative
=========================================================

I am currently on a team in a program called the Digital Problem Solving Initative, through the Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. This program creates several teams of students (from all divisions within Harvard) that work together with a professor to tackle a digital or technological problem on the Harvard campus.
 
My team is under the mentorship of Jim Waldo (CTO of Harvard) and is working on re-vamping the educational data collection and synthesis for Harvard, MIT, and EdX. 
 
We are creating a better system for gathering data in an organized and consistent way and working with lawyers to tackle some of the legal-based privacy issues associated with it's distribution to other parties.
